This repository contains our final Contextual chatbot "chatbot_app.py" or "chatbot" as a Jupyter Notebook. All necesarry custom files are included, except from the folder "bert_Finetuned_Squad_Local", and a valid API Key for GPT3, which you will get by following the setup below:

1. Go to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MEcBuMFIglKThYeC9bh2quR1smMpMemJ?usp=share_link to download the missing folder "bert_Finetuned_Squad_Local".
2. Replace the folder "bert_Finetuned_Squad_Local" with the new one, in the same repository as the chatbot.
3. Open "requirements.txt" and make sure that all modules are installed and up to date.
4. Go to https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys and use an already existing account or create new account to create a new valid API KEY, by clicking on "Create new secret key" 
5. Remember to update the value of the variable "OPEN_API_KEY" to your newly generated key, in either "chatbot_app.py" or "chatbot".
6. Run either "chatbot_app.py" or "chatbot" to interact with the chatbot.

This repository also contains:
